The appendable file which contains all of the blacklisted paths its for this reason I currently cannot finish the c++ version of 
the app as I don't know how to read a file and add each line to a list I searched everywher but found nothing I even 
asked on stackoverflow but it didnt work out. Despite this I am still working on the c++ version and will attempt 
to finish it soon after I find an answer to my problem.
